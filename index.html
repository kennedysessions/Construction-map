	<h1><strong> New York City construction fatalities and injuries decline in 2024</h1></strong>

<div class="subh">
	<p>City data shows fewer construction workers died this year than in nearly ten years with more city-planned construction to come.</p>

	<p>Five construction workers died on the job in New York City in 2024 and 482 were injured. According to data from the NYC Department of Buildings, the numbers show a drop from 2023 when seven construction workers died and 692 were injured.</p>

	<p>This marks New York City's lowest fatality and injury rate since 2015.</p>

</script>

	<p>As construction activity remains consistent post-pandemic, levels are expected to increase following the city council's <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/882-24/mayor-adams-governor-hochul-speaker-adams-celebrates-passage-most-pro-housing-proposal-in"> approval of Mayor Eric Adams's City of Yes Housing plan</a>, which aims to build 80,000 housing units over the next 15 years.</p>

	<p>"There is nothing more important than safety. The annual DOB Construction Safety Report shows the progress the city has made in reducing the number of construction-related fatalities to the lowest number in a decade. With that said, there is still more work to be done as workplace injuries are still a concern," ABC Empire State Chapter President Brian Sampson said in a <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/buildings/dob/pr-cons-safety-week-2024.page"> press release.</a></p>
